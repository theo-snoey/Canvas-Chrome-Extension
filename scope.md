  await backgroundQueue.add(tasks);

  // 3. Execute in optimized batches
  await processQueueInBackground();

  // 4. Update local data store
  await updateLocalDataStore();

  // 5. Schedule next sync (5 minutes)
  scheduleNextSync();
};
```

#### **Comprehensive Data Schema**
```javascript
// Semester data structure
const SemesterData = {
  semesterId: String,
  courses: Array<CourseData>,
  lastSync: Date,
  dataQuality: Number,
