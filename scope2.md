# Canvas LMS Chat Assistant - Scope 2.0
*AI-Powered Chat Interface with OpenAI Integration*

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive Chrome extension that replaces the current popup with a large, intelligent chat interface. The extension will perform thorough Canvas data scraping, store all content locally, and use OpenAI's Chat API to provide intelligent responses about coursework, generate homework lists, and execute assignments.

## Core Requirements
- **Chat Interface**: Large chat window (~50% screen size) replacing current popup
- **Immediate Scraping**: Full Canvas scrape on Chrome startup (within 10 seconds)
- **Background Refresh**: Re-scrape every 10 minutes to maintain data freshness
- **OpenAI Integration**: Use project API key + Project ID for all chat responses
- **Assignment Execution**: Generate written responses/essays for assignments
- **File Processing**: Download and extract text content from Canvas files
- **Current Semester Focus**: Only active/dashboard courses, not archived ones
- **Query by Due Date**: Chat can filter assignments by when they're due
